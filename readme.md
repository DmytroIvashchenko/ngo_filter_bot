Telegram bot project for the NGO Filter.

The bot is developed on the Telebot library.

The bot allows you to see the activities of an NGO, submit an idea for a project, 
register for an event, sign up for a consultation, and write down your needs, 
all of which are recorded in a Google spreadsheet in a relevant sheet.
